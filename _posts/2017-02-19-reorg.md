I've reorganized the listings of my code libraries to point people more directly to my current work in three areas:

1. generically applicable code libraries implementing the abstract [models of the CITE architecture](https://neelsmith.github.io/cite/)
2. libraries for working with digital representations of [ancient Greek](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek_language/)
3. libraries for working with the archive of [the Homer Multitext project](https://neelsmith.github.io/hmt/)


All of the code is in Scala; almost all is organized to cross-compile for use either on the JVM or Javascript engines, since most of its concerns are equally relevant in almost any environment, from single-page web app to distributed cluster computing.

Binary releases are published on jcenter, and in addition to manual download can be used from maven, gradle or ivy dependencies as well as sbt.  See the linked pages for details.
