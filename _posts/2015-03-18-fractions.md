I've added initial specifications for working with fractional values in "Milesian" notation to the [`greeklang` library](http://neelsmith.github.io/greeklang/): specifications for tokens in Milesian notation now covering integers, fractions, and compound expressions combining integers and fractions are  [here](http://neelsmith.github.io/greeklang/specs/greek/tokens/milesian/Milesian.html).

As [previously noted](http://neelsmith.github.io/2015/03/15/milesian/), I'm leaving open for the moment the question of how to represent fractional values using ASCII-only characters, but now anyone who is happy with Unicode can compose integer and fractional values to a defined specification.
