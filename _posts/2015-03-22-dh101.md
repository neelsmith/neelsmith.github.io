I've started a new repository with a simple checklist of key points to know before starting a digital scholarship project.  The list comes out of discussion in the informal Friday morning "Fundamental of Digital Humanities" that I take part in at Holy Cross along with a group of seniors working on digital projects.  In the future, I hope we could link more expanded discussions to each point, but for now, the bare checklist gives us something to consider:  [http://neelsmith.github.io/dh101/](http://neelsmith.github.io/dh101/).
