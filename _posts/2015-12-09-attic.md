I've added a new orthographic module to the `greeklang` project.  The [`attic` library ](http://neelsmith.github.io/greeklang/attic/) supports working with texts in the alphabet used in Athens prior to 403 BCE.  It implements the same `GreekOrthography` interface as the classes in the `greeklang` [foundational libraries](http://neelsmith.github.io/greeklang/basics/), and in this 1.0.0. release provides similar methods for working with strings, word tokens, syllabification, accentuation and phonology.

API docs are in place:  testable specifications are in draft form and will be included in the web page for `attic` in the near future.
