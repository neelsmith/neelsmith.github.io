I've added some specifications to the library for working with Greek in the Attic alphabet.  The [initial announcement](http://neelsmith.github.io/2015/12/09/attic/) of the library includes some technical information, but the specifications offer a more readable introduction than API docs (also available for reference). Because the specifications include automated tests, you can trust the sections with passing tests <strong style="background-color: #afa !important;">highlighted in green</strong>.

There is more to be done (most notably, adding support for the acrophonic numeric notation used in Attic inscriptions), but the current document thoroughly specifies two encoding conventions for texts in the alphabet used in Athens prior to 403 BCE. If you want to type the kind of documents that Thucydides could read in Athens, the specifications are here:

(Home page for the library, including links to API documentation, is <http://neelsmith.github.io/greeklang/attic/>.)
