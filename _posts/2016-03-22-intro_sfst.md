The introductory post in this series proposed four requirements for a Latin parsing system, and defined two key technologies for implementing a parser, namely, a finite state transducer, and a build system.

This post applies some basic patterns for morphological analysis to begin developing a Latin parsing system,  using the SFST toolkit to compile and work with finite state transducers (FSTs).  Since the SFST website includes both a user manual and a helpful introductory tutorial, I'll focus directly on some
