I recently noticed [this provocative post](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/09/30/surprise-surprise-the-web-turns-out-to-be-too-persistent/) by Kent Anderson, Publisher at AAAS/Science.  I understand the individual words he uses, but am having trouble believing that I correctly understand his breath-taking claims.

To take one example from a  crucial point in his argument, Anderson writes

> We can no longer depend on the scarcity of print or the difficulties of distance or barriers of professional expertise to narrow access down to experts with a true need.


I think this means something like


>The inadequacy of our technology is no longer sufficient to mask our reliance on appeal to authority in lieu of demonstrable competence.

But surely that's not possible, it is?
