One conversation I have repeatedly centers around why we should use technology-indepedent URNs for scholarly citation.  Sometimes, I can almost see the lightbulbs turning on in people's minds.  At other times, it feels like we are speaking different languages.

For those who enjoy the language of English romantic poetry and in particular of John Keats, I present my views in [this linked PDF](/public/ode.pdf) in a form that I hope they will find easier to follow, or at least more agreeable.
