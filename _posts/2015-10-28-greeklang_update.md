 The 1.1.0 release of [greeklang foundational libraries][ghpage] adds a new `Syllable` class with static methods for dividing a `GreekWord` into syllables.  Unit tests include a selection of difficult cases collected by applying the code to the complete text of the Homer Multitext project edition of the Venetus A manuscript.
