I pushed up a 0.1.0 version of [`listutils`](http://neelsmith.github.io/listutils/), utilities including comparison and diff'ing of ordered lists of any type of object, including Longest Common Sequence (LCS), using the commonly used algorithm described [here](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/96optimization/LCS.java.html).
