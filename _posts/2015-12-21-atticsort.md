Version **1.0.3** of the `attic` library corrects the behavior of sorting Greek in Attic orthography.  Only alphabetic characters excluding the aspirate are taken into consideration: editorial characters such as vowel quantity markers and accents are ignored.

**Examples**:  The preposition <strong>APO</strong> sorts before <strong>BOLE</strong> but after the feminine nominative plural of the article, <strong>HAI</strong>.  (For further examples, see the [live specifications for sorting](http://neelsmith.github.io/greeklang/attic/documentation/orthography/AtticSort.html).)
