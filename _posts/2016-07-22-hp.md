I've previously commented on how the [OCHO2 model of citable text lets us choose  convenient formats](http://neelsmith.github.io/2016/07/18/ohco2_formats/) for particular purposes, since we can verify the equivalence of each representation under OHCO2.  So why not manage multiple archival formats in your repository if you like?

That's possible with today's [update to the `hocuspocus`](http://cite-architecture.github.io/2016/07/22/cite_and_hp/) library.  Mix and mingle XML, Markdown, or delimited text formats, and unify all of them in a single RDF representation you can deliver in the Canonical Text Service protocol using the cite servlet 2 webapp (`cs2`).

There's more to be done: detailed examples need to be presented and explained, and I'm sure I haven't recognized all the implications of these new capabilities yet, but I think will be liberating and powerful to work with material in this range of formats as citable texts.
