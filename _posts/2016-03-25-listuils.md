I've released a 1.0.0 version of my `listutils` package.  Like the previous versions, it supports comparing and diff'ing of ordered lists of any type of object.  It uses the same dynamic programming algorithm with memoizing arrays as the previous version, but in addition to computing the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and elements unique to each list, it now computes the Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS) as well.

Web site for the package: <http://neelsmith.github.io/listutils/>
