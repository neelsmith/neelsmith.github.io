title: Convert XML texts from beta code to Unicode
tags:

---

Classicists have been active digitally since before the first Unicode standard, and long-standing projects like Perseus have a legacy of XML texts encoding Greek in the ASCII convention called "beta code."  Converting the encoding of the text content of an XML document while leaving the XML markup untouched can be a headache, so I've pushed a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/neelsmith/7549ad5942750ef7ad55) that reduces that to a single command.  It's written in [groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) and uses its [grape](http://groovy-lang.org/grape.html) dependency manager to download all supporting libraries.  The converted XML is written to standard output, so in a POSIXy operating system you can create a UTF-8 version of your beta code XML text with

    groovy beta2Utf8Xml.groovy BETACODEFILE.xml > UTF8FILE.xml
