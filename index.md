### Code libraries ###


A selection of my openly available work on github (from most general, to project-specific):



- citing scholarly resources:  [implementing models of the CITE architecture](cite)
- working with digital representations of [ancient Greek](greek_language)
- the [Homer Multitext project](hmt)


### Binary releases

Binary releases of the above code libraries are available through jcenter, linked from my personal repository at
