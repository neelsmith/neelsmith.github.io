I've begun work this fall on a system for parsing ancient Greek morphologically.  The decisions I'm forced to make in designing and implementing the system have already led me to think much more carefully about morphology as a linguistic system, as well as about how to work with morphological phenomena computationally.  I plan to elaborate on my experience in a series of posts here, and am beginning by making explicit my approach to two essential questions:

1. How does a system for parsing Greek morphology fit into a larger environment of digital scholarship?
1. How do we understand the relation of digital texts and tools for studying them to a historical language like Greek?

## Digital tools for historical languages
