Herbert Weir Smyth's *Greek Grammar*[^n1] belongs to a genre that delights in
algorithmically precise description and encyclopedic completeness. In
the twenty-first century, large sections of it beg to be implemented in code.

Section XXX (140) describes the syllabification....  YY regular expressions.

Complicated by explicit representation of breathing which Smyth tacitly ignores. Good example of difficulties of DH work.


[^n1]: NB: Smyth edition of (1919?) / (1956?)
