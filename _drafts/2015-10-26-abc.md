The central challenge of digital scholarship is ...

Consider digital scholarly editions.

Machine actionable.  Does not mean no uncertainty about source text. (TEI `unclear`)
Text it documents may even be ambiguous.  (Editor may disambiguate eg NER, or may leave)
But the edition represents that uncertainy about or ambiguity in the source text
unambiguously.

In this regard, an edition more closely resembles a computer program.

Requires an explictly defined alphabet.
Rigorously defined normalization of Greek.

Inevitably context dependent creep in.  Backslash protection.  God help you in Java.

GreekString class for rigorously edited text.  Two representations in 1<->1 mapping.  Includes all orthographically expressed features of Greek written language.  Other features included in MSS not in some sense "linguistic".  GreekMsString accepts these.  Lossy in ASCII.

GreekWord is a single "word" in classicists' sense, CS token.  Ascii only.
Suitable for processing. Not concerned here with

Unicode Greek is horrible.

- sigma
- numbers. confusion of milesian characters.
- numbers.  confusion of acrophonic characters.
- punctuation.  circularity of ano teleia.

Apologies to anyone so old and unfortunate that the title of this post put a Jackson 5 earworm in your brain.
