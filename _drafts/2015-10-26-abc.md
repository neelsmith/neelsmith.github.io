The central challenge of digital scholarship is ...

Consider digital scholarly editions.

Machine actionable.  Does not mean no uncertainty about source text. (TEI `unclear`)
Text it documents may even be ambiguous.  (Editor may disambiguate eg NER, or may leave)
But the edition represents that uncertainy about or ambiguity in the source text
unambiguously.

In this regard, an edition more closely resembles a computer program.

Requires an explictly defined alphabet.
Rigorously defined normalization of Greek.

Apologies to anyone so old and unfortunate that the title of this post put a Jackson 5 earworm in your brain.
