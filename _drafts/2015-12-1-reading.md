- close reading -> distant reading
- highly theorized -> iteration between bottom-up and theoretically oriented questions
- questions accessible only to initiated -> widely accessible
- isolated individual  -> group
- activity best pursued by experienced senior scholars -> undergrads can contribute
- aimed at elite audience -> wide engagement
- in classics, focus on "best" critical edition -> corpus of diplomatic editions


nagging doubt ("Is this anything but a parlor game?") -> unafraid to ask big questions ("what is this text about?  how does language work in this text?")
